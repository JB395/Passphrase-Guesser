# Passphrase-Guesser

A program to recover miss-typed passphrases for encrypted wallets using the qtumd server application and the qtum-cli command line interface.

Set the full path, relative path for the Python script to find the binary executables, or place the Python script in the same directory as the qtumd and qtum-cli executables.

The script reads a text file “work.txt” which contains variations of the passphrase with typos inserted.
